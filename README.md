## Introduction

Personally speaking, I've never been much of a serious *hacker* myself;    
that is apart from experimenting with learning to use multiple different programming languages;    
so, for example, using just one single programming language,     
one finds there are 10+ different ways to write 'Hello, world!'.    

I also know that as most programming languages can output text files;  
and, programming languages themselves are, in fact, mostly all text based, including:    
[.c]/[.cpp]/[.bat]/[.ps1]/-etc.;    
therefore, quite naturally, it follows that you can use one programming language...    
to output code using a next programming language...;   
so, for example, a QBASIC program [.bas] can also be used to write/output [.html] files      
that is, if the programmer themselves wishes to produce such work.     

Apart from that, I have had an interest in doing purely *amateur* cryptography: eg. experimenting with...   

- writing code going: forwards/backwards   
- exploring creating both substitutional/and, also, transpositional cipers       
- Caeser Cipher/Rot 13   
- etc.

I have also played around with various OS/Operating Systems, including:  
- Windows (my main OS)  
- Unix (occassional practice)  
- Mac OS (very rarely, indeed/too 'expensive'; however, I did hear it's very Unix-like/Linux-like;   
  and, learning to use Linux is FREE/unless you wish to pay to have Linux in a hosted environment, instead)

I'm also *aware*, at least, of such things as:  
- Internet protocols: /RFC's/HTTP/HTTPS/FTP/FTPS  
- MS DOS Tools: PING/TraceRoute/IP Config    
- The 7 layered Open OSI/Open Systems Interconnect model  
- Hardware (CISCO)
- white hat/black hat hackers 
- Postman/Kali Linux (heard of...never actualy used it)   
- TOR web browser  
- Bit coins/and, Cryptochain technologies    
- etc.

So, as somebody who is very deeply interested in learning more about computing systems in general;      
I have heard of the *hacking* field; and, will occassionally go and either:  

- Watch videos
- Read articles    
...about it.

-(**NOTE**: I never said I was a *master* of anything mentioned up above;   
but, just that I had a 'passing interest' in learning more about it;  
by which I mean to imply that I am no **expert** hacker;   
but, instead, just a complete and total  *amateur*.)-  

Anyway, here on this page, I intend to include some *hacking* resources I found whilst out surfing around the net.

I will also list a few of my own *hacking* experiences, as well.  

## Personal hacking experience 1

Whenever I go to visit my local library to use their publically available computers;  
sometimes, when I sign in using both my *username/password* combination;  
I find that certain parts of the Windows OS/Operating System machine has been **locked** down;    
for example, the user has no easy access to using accessory programs such as: Notepad/MS Paint;  
not if the [Start] menu has been disabled...; and, only the 'web browser' part is enabled, alone;   
but, these are programs which I tend to use regularly every single day inside of my own home...???     

So, I will usually find a way to work around it...;  
by deliberately choose to go run those programs, anyway;    
first, you need to be familiar with what is the underlying OS...;  
for instance, there is not just Windows GUI-Graphical User Interface/  
but, there is also MS DOS CLI/Command Line Interface...;  
which also allows one to run/execute programs.  
Thus, one has to know exactly where certain programs are located/    
or else, the many different methods by which such programs can be called up to run.
