## Introduction

Personally speaking, I've never been much of a serious *hacker* myself;  
that is apart from experimenting with learning to use multiple different programming languages;  
so, for example, using just one single programming language, one finds there are 10+ different ways to write 'Hello, world!'.  

I also know that as most programming languages can output text files;  
and, programming languages themselves are, in fact, mostly all text based, including:    
[.c]/[.cpp]/[.bat]/[.ps1]/-etc.;    
therefore, quite naturally, it follows that you can use one programming language...  
to output code using a next programming language...; 
so, for example, a QBASIC program [.bas] can also be used to write/output [.html] files    
that is, if the programmer themselves wishes to produce such work.     

Apart from that, I have had an interest in doing purely *amateur* cryptography: eg. experimenting with...   

- writing code going: forwards/backwards   
- exploring creating both substitutional/and, also, transpositional cipers       
- Caeser Cipher/Rot 13   
- etc.

I have also played around with various OS/Operating Systems, including:  
- Windows (my main OS)  
- Unix (occassional practice)  
- Mac OS (very rarely, indeed/too 'expensive'; however, I did hear it's very Unix-like/Linux-like;   
  and, learning to use Linux is FREE/unless you wish to pay to have Linux in a hosted environment, instead)

I'm also *aware*, at least, of such things as:  
- Internet protocols: /RFC's/HTTP/HTTPS/FTP/FTPS  
- MS DOS Tools: PING/TraceRoute/IP Config    
- The 7 layered Open OSI/Open Systems Interconnect model  
- Hardware (CISCO)
- white hat/black hat hackers 
- Postman/Kali Linux (heard of...never actualy used it)   
- TOR web browser  
- Bit coins/and, Cryptochain technologies    
- etc.

So, as somebody who is very deeply interested in learning more about computing systems in general;      
I have heard of the *hacking* field; and, will occassionally go and either:  

- Watch videos
- Read articles    
...about it.

-(**NOTE**: I never said I was a *master* of anything mentioned above; 
but, just that I had a passing interest in learning more about it;  
by which I mean to imply that I am no **expert** hacker; but, instead, just a complete and total  *amateur*.)-  

Anyway, here on this page, I intend to include some *hacking* resources I found whilst out surfing around the net.
