## Introduction

Personally speaking, I've never been much of a serious *hacker* myself;    
that is apart from experimenting with learning to use multiple different programming languages;    
so, for example, using just one single programming language,     
one finds there are 10+ different ways to write 'Hello, world!'.    

I also know that as most programming languages can output text files;  
and, programming languages themselves are, in fact, mostly all text based, including:    
[.c]/[.cpp]/[.bat]/[.ps1]/-etc.;    
therefore, quite naturally, it follows that you can use one programming language...    
to output code using a next programming language...;   
so, for example, a QBASIC program [.bas] can also be used to write/output [.html] files      
that is, if the programmer themselves wishes to produce such work.     

Apart from that, I have had an interest in doing purely *amateur* cryptography: eg. experimenting with...   

- writing code going: forwards/backwards   
- exploring creating both substitutional/and, also, transpositional cipers       
- Caeser Cipher/Rot 13   
- etc.

I have also played around with various OS/Operating Systems, including:  
- Windows (my main OS)  
- Unix (occassional practice)  
- Mac OS (very rarely, indeed/too 'expensive'; however, I did hear it's very Unix-like/Linux-like;   
  and, learning to use Linux is FREE/unless you wish to pay to have Linux in a hosted environment, instead)

I'm also *aware*, at least, of such things as:  
- Internet protocols: /RFC's/HTTP/HTTPS/FTP/FTPS  
- MS DOS Tools: PING/TraceRoute/IP Config    
- The 7 layered Open OSI/Open Systems Interconnect model  
- Hardware (CISCO)
- white hat/black hat hackers 
- Postman/Kali Linux (heard of...never actualy used it)   
- TOR web browser  
- Bit coins/and, Cryptochain technologies    
- etc.

So, as somebody who is very deeply interested in learning more about computing systems in general;      
I have heard of the *hacking* field; and, will occassionally go and either:  

- Watch videos
- Read articles    
...about it.

-(**NOTE**: I never said I was a *master* of anything mentioned up above;   
but, just that I had a 'passing interest' in learning more about it;  
by which I mean to imply that I am no **expert** hacker;   
but, instead, just a complete and total  *amateur*.)-  

Anyway, here on this page, I intend to include some *hacking* resources I found whilst out surfing around the net.

I will also list a few of my own *hacking* experiences, as well.  

## Personal hacking experience 1/Computing history lists

Whenever one gets onto a computer...; and, does such things as create/save files...;  
or, even, browse the net using a *web browser*...;  
many of your actions are being recorded in either one way or another.  

For example, there is...  
- the Run command 'history' list    
- the Web browser 'history' list  
- the Downloads folder 'history' list
- etc.  

This all means that anybody who has access to your own computer/    
or, public work computer.../-etc.;   
and, who also knows where to locate these 'history' items are...;   
they can also trace through exactly what you were doing, previously, on the computer as well.   

## Personal hacking experience 2/Windows Powershell history list

It was only just recently that I was playing around with using Windows Powershell platform;   
that I happened to discover it's possible to choose to record all of the Powershell session commands 'history'.    

I didn't know that such a thing was possible before;     
so, whenever one learns certain specific hacking techniques;         
then, it also teaches you to be able to defend against it;    
namely, close down the previous Powershell window;  
and, start a brand 'new' Powershell window session, instead.    


## Personal hacking experience 3/Unlocking public computer files

Whenever I go to visit my local library to use their publically available computers;  
sometimes, when I sign in using both my *username/password* combination;  
I find that certain parts of the Windows OS/Operating System machine     
has already been **locked** down by the system administrators;    
for example, the user has no easy access to using accessory programs such as: Notepad/MS Paint;    
not if the [Start] menu has been disabled...; and, only the 'web browser' part is enabled, alone;     
but, these are programs which I tend to use regularly every single day inside of my own home...???       

So, I will usually find a way to work around it...;  
by, deliberately, choosing to go run those programs which are my *favourite*, anyway;        
first, you need to be familiar with what is the underlying OS/Operating System...;    
for instance, there is not just Windows GUI-Graphical User Interface/  
but, there is also the older: MS DOS CLI/Microsoft Disk Operatng System Command Line Interface...;     
which also allow users to be able to run/execute programs.    
Thus, one has to know exactly where certain programs are located/    
or else, the many different methods by which such programs may be called upon to run;  
there is, usually, far more than only 'one' way;  
for example, I can think of 5 -or, even, 10- different ways   
of launching Notepad word processor application using Windows.         

## Personal hacking experience 4/Work -or, training course- computer...hidden files

It is possible to get into a publically available computer system...;  
such was when on a computer based training course;  
and, create a Desktop -(or, otherwise, 'hidden' folder)-  which contains your *own* files;    
this is done so that nobody else -without having truly sufficient knowledge-   
will be allowed to either access/or, change what are your *private* files.  

## Personal hacking experience 5: Remote computer...Linux 'root' privilege  

I recall using Linux, remotely...on a hosted machine;  
where I was giving somebody lessons...on how to use Linux commands;    
because I myself was privellged as being 'root';  
therefore, I had full access to all of the 'history' commands they had typed in;    
as well as, access to all of their files/folders.    

**NOTE**: There was no serious information found...just merely practice *test* files.
