## Introduction

Personally speaking, I've never been much of a *hacker* myself;  
that is apart from experimenting with learning to use multiple different programming languages;  
so, for example, using just one single programming language, one finds there are 10+ different ways to write 'Hello, world!'.  

Apart from that, I have had an interest in doing purely *amateur* cryptography: eg. experimenting with...   

- writing code going: forwards/backwards   
- exploring creating both substitutional/and, also, transpositional cipers       
- Caeser Cipher/Rot 13   
- etc.

I have also played around with various OS/Operating Systems, including:  
- Windows (my main OS)  
- Unix (occassional practice)  
- Mac OS (very rarely, indeed/too 'expensive'; however, I did hear it's very Unix-like/Linux-like;   
  and, learning to use Linux is FREE/unless you wish to pay to have Linux in a hosted environment, instead)

I'm also *aware*, at least, of such things as:  
- Internet protocols/RFC's
- MS DOS Tools: PING/TraceRoute/IP Config    
- The Open OSI model  
- Hardware (CISCO)  
- etc.

So, as somebody who is very deeply interested in computing systems in general;    
I have heard of the *hacking* field; and, will occassionally go and either:  

- Watch videos
- Read articles
...about it.

-(**NOTE**: I never said I was a *master* of anything mentioned above; 
but, just that I had a passing interest in learning more about it;  
by which I mean to imply that I am no **expert** hacker; but, instead, just a total *amateur*.)-  

Here, I intend to include some internet resources I found whilst out surfing the net.
